            <u>photography</u> and <u>history</u> and this
            website is the place where I will be posting about my different passions.
        </p>
        <p>Those will cover synthesis of my different readings, projects oriented articles where I'll explore various
            tech topics and perhaps a few hot takes !
            Sit down, get a cup of coffee and browse away ! üçµ </p>
